    Load up on guns, bring your friends
    It's fun to lose and to pretend
    She's over-bored and self-assured
    Oh no, I know a dirty word
    Hello, hello, hello, how low
    Hello, hello, hello, how low
    Hello, hello, hello, how low
    Hello, hello, hello
    With the lights out, it's less dangerous
    Here we are now, entertain us
    I feel stupid and contagious
    Here we are now, entertain us
    A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
    Yeah, hey
    I'm worse at what I do best
    And for this gift I feel blessed
    Our little group has always been
    And always will until the end
    Hello, hello, hello, how low
    Hello, hello, hello, how low
    Hello, hello, hello, how low
    Hello, hello, hello
    With the lights out, it's less dangerous
    Here we are now, entertain us
    I feel stupid and contagious
    Here we are now, entertain us
    A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
    Yeah, hey
    And I forget just why I taste
    Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
    I found it hard, was hard to find
    Oh well, whatever, never mind
    Hello, hello, hello, how low
    Hello, hello, hello, how low
    Hello, hello, hello, how low
    Hello, hello, hello
    With the lights out, it's less dangerous
    Here we are now, entertain us
    I feel stupid and contagious
    Here we are now, entertain us
    A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
    A denial, a denial, a denial, a denial, a denial
    A denial, a denial, a denial, a denial
